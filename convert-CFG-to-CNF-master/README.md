Introduction
============

**Context-Free Grammars (CFG)**, is a powerful method of describing context free languages that possess recursive structure, which makes them useful in a variety of applications. A language is context free if and only if pushdown automaton (PDA) recognizes it. Many useful languages are context-free, **including most programming languages, query languages, and markup languages**.  

However, CFG can be ambiguous or sometimes unambigious generates from the same language. A grammar is called **inherently ambiguous** if there is no equivalent umambiguous grammar to generates it. When working with context-free grammars CFG, it is often convenient to have them in simplified form. One of the simplest and most useful forms is called the **Chomsky normal form**.  

This application attempt to receive CFG as input and transformed into CNF grammar expressing as same language, all the **procedure and steps** are shown in the program.
